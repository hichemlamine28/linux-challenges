Check out this special challenge series to help you prepare for Linux certification exams. Head over to the Linux Challenge Series to put all of your skills to the test.

The Linux challenge series is a set of hands-on challenges designed to test your mastery of Linux concepts, and will help you get ready to obtain Linux certifications, such as the Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator certification..

These challenges will test you on a wide variety of Linux concepts, often combining several areas of study into a single challenge that reflects not only performance-based Linux exams, but also the real-world challenges that Linux administrators encounter in their daily work.

The topics may include:

    Disk partitioning and Linux filesystem management
    User and group management
    File search and manipulation
    Permissions and fundamental security concepts
    Process management
    Package management
    Service configuration (http, databases, proxy)
    Container and Virtual Machine management
    Networking, route management, and packet filtering

The interface of these challenges is divided into two parts:

1: The top half contains the Quiz portal where the details related to the challenge are displayed along with an interactive Architecture diagram.

Click on the icons and the arrow connectors in the architecture diagram and an associated task (if available) will be displayed on the Quiz portal.

2: The bottom half of the interface contains the terminal which you will use to complete the tasks.

To validate if a task is complete, you can click on the “Check” button. If complete, the icons in the Architecture diagram will be highlighted in green. If something is yet to be completed, it will be highlighted in red.

To complete the challenge, you must complete all the tasks.
